This Chapter gives an introduction to most of the terminology used later in the book.
By $\N$ we denote the set of natural numbers, including zero. The set $\Z/n\Z$ of integers modulo $n$ is denoted by $\Z_n$; its elements are written as $\bar i := i + n\Z$. When we regard $\Z_2 = \set{\bar 0, \bar 1}$ as a field, we also denote it as $\F_2 = \set{0, 1}$. For a real number $x$ we denote by $\floor{x}$ the greatest integer $\le x$, and by $\ceil{x}$ the least integer $\ge x$. Logarithms written as 'log' are taken at base $2$; the natural logarithm will be denoted by 'ln'. The expression $x := y$ and $y =: x$ mean that $x$ is being defined as $y$.
A set $\mathcal{A} = \set{A_1, \dots, A_k}$ of disjoint subsets of a set $A$ is a **partition** of $A$ if the union $\bigcup \mathcal{A}$ of all the sets $A_i\in \mathcal{A}$ is $A$ and $A_i \ne \emptyset$ for every $i$. Another partition $\set{A_1', \dots, A_\ell'}$ of $A$ **refines** the partition $\mathcal{A}$ if each $A'_i$ is contained in some $A_j$.
By $[A]^k$ we denote the set of all $k$-element subsets of $A$. Sets with $k$ elements will be called *$k$-sets*; subsets with $k$ elements are *$k$-subsets*.
# Graphs
A **graph** is a pair $G = (V, E)$ of sets such that $E \sube [V]^2$; thus, the elements of $E$ are 2-element subsets of $V$. To avoid notational ambiguities, we shall always assume tacitly that $V \cap E = \emptyset$.
The elements of $V$ are the **vertices** (or **nodes**, or **points**) of the graph $G$, the elements of $E$ are its edges (or lines). The usual way to picture a graph is by drawing a dot for each vertex and joining two of these dots by a line if the corresponding two vertices form an edge. Just how these dots and lines are draw is considered irrelevant: all that matters is the information of which pairs of vertices form an edge and which do not.
A graph with vertex set $V$ is said to be a graph **on** $V$. The vertex set of a graph $G$ is referred to as $V(G)$, its edge set as $E(G)$. These conventions are independent of any actual names of these two sets: the vertex set $W$ of a graph $H = (W, F)$ is still referred to as $V(H)$, not as $W(H)$. We shall not always distinguish strictly between a graph and its vertex or edge set. For example, we may speak of a vertex $v\in G$ (rather than $v\in V(G)$), and edge $e\in G$, and so on.
The number of vertices of a graph $G$ is its **order**, written as $|G|$;
its number of edges is denoted as $\norm{G}$. Graphs are **finite**, **infinite**, **countable** and so on according to their order. Except in Chapter 8, our graphs will be finite unless otherwise stated.
For the *empty graph* $(\emptyset, \emptyset)$ we simply write $\emptyset$. A graph of order $0$ or $1$ is called *trivial*. Sometimes, e.g. to start an induction, trivial graphs can be useful; at other times they form silly counterexamples and become a nuisance. To avoid cluttering the text with non-triviality conditions, we shall mostly treat the trivial graphs, and particularly the empty graph $\emptyset$, with generous disregard.
A vertex $v$ is **incident** with an edge $e$ if $v\in e$; then e is an edge *at* $v$.
The two vertices incident with an edge are its **endvertices** or ends, and an edge *joins* its *ends*. An edge $\set{x, y}$ is usually written as $xy$ (or $yx$). If $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$, then $xy$ is an *$X-Y$ edge*. The set of all $X-Y$ edges in a set $E$ is denoted by $E(X, Y)$; instead of $E(\set{x}, Y)$ and $E(Y, \set{x})$ we simply write $E(x, Y)$ and $E(X, y)$. The set of all the edges in $E$ at a vertex $v$ is denoted by $E(v)$.
Two vertices $x$, $y$ of $G$ are **adjacent**, or **neighbours**, if $\set{x, y}$ is an edge of $G$. Two edges $e\ne f$ are **adjacent** if they have an end in common. If all the vertices of $G$ are pairwise adjacent, then $G$ is a **complete**. A complete graph on $n$ vertices is a $K^n$; a $K^3$ is called a **triangle**.
A set of vertices or of edges is **independent** if no two of its elements are adjacent. Independent sets of vertices are also called **stable**.
Let $G = (V, E)$ and $G'=(V',E')$ be two graphs. A map $\varphi: V \to V'$ is a *homomorphism* from $G$ to $G'$ if it preserves the adjacency of vertices, that is, if $\set{\varphi(x), \varphi(y)} \in E'$ whenever $\set{x, y} \in E$. Then, in particular, every vertex $x'$ in the image of $\varphi$ its inverse image $\varphi^{-1}(x')$ is an independent set of vertices in $G$. If $\varphi$ is bijective and its inverse $\varphi^{-1}$ is also a homomorphism (so that $xy \in E \iff \varphi(x)\varphi(y) \in E'$ for all $x, y\in V$), we call $\varphi$ an *isomorphism*, say that $G$ and $G'$ are *isomorphic*, and write $G \iso G'$. An isomorphism form $G$ to itself is an *automorphism* of $G$.
We do not normally distinguish between isomorphic graphs. Thus, we usually write $G = G'$ rather than $G \iso G'$, speak of *the* complete graph on 17 vertices, and so on. If we wish to emphasize that we are only interested in the isomorphism type of a give graph, we informally refer to it as an *abstract graph*.
A class of graphs that is closed under isomorphism is called a *graph property*. For example, 'containing a triangle' is a graph property: if $G$ contains three pairwise adjacent vertices then so does every graph isomorphic to $G$. A map taking graphs as arguments is called a *graph invariant* if it assigns equal values to isomorphic graphs. The number of vertices and the number of edges of a graph are two simple graph invariants; the greatest number of pairwise adjacent vertices is another.
We set $G \cup G' := (V \cup V', E \cup E')$ and $G \cap G' := (V \cap V', E \cap E')$. If $G \cup G' = \nil$, then $G$ and $G'$ are *disjoint*. If $V' \sube V$ and $E' \sube E$, then $G'$ is a *subgraph* of $G$ (and $G$ a *supergraph* of $G'$), written as $G' \sube G$. Less formally, we say that $G$ *contains* $G'$.
If $G' \sube G$ and $G' \ne G$, then $G'$ is a *proper subgraph* of $G$.
# Connectivity
A graph $G$ is called *connected* if it is non-empty and any two of its vertices are linked by a path in $G$. If $U \sube V(G)$ and $G[U]$ is connected, we also call $U$ itself connected (in $G$). Instead of 'not connected' we usually say 'disconnected'.
# Some linear algebra
A set $F$ of edges is a *cut* in $G$ if there exists a partition $\set{V_1, V_2}$ of $V$ such that $F = E(V_1, V2)$. The edges in $F$ are said to *cross* this partition. The sets $V_1$, $V2$ are the *sides* of the cut. Recall that for $V_1 = \set{v}$ this cut is denoted by $E(v)$. A minimal non-empty cut in $G$ is a *bond*.
# Other notions of graphs
For completeness, we now mention a few other notions of graphs which feature less frequently or not at all in this book.
A **hypergraph** is a pair $(V, E)$ of disjoint sets, where the elements of $E$ are non-empty subsets (of any cardinality) of $V$. Thus, graphs are special hypergraphs.
A **directed graph** (or **digraph**) is a pair $(V, E)$ of disjoint sets (of **vertices** and **edges**) together with two maps $\init : E \to V$ and $\ter : E \to V$ assigning to every edge $e$ an **initial vertex** $\init(e)$ and a **terminal vertex** $\ter(e)$. The edge $e$ is said to be **directed from $\init(e)$ to $\ter(e)$**. Note that a directed graph may have several edges between the same two vertices $x, y$. Such edges are called **multiple edges**; if they have the same direction (say from $x$ to $y$), they are **parallel**.
If $\init(e) = \ter(e)$, the edge $e$ is called a **loop**.
A directed graph $D$ is an **orientation** of an (undirected) graph $G$ if $V(D) = V(G)$ and $E(D) = E(G)$, and if $\set{\init(e), \ter(e)} = \set{x, y}$ for every edge $e = xy$. Intuitively, such as **oriented graph** arises from an undirected graph simply by directing every edge from one of its ends to the other. Put differently, oriented graphs are directed graphs without loops or multiple edges.
A **multigraph** is a pair $(V, E)$ of disjoint sets (of **vertices** and **edges**) together with a map $E \to V \cup [V]^2$.
